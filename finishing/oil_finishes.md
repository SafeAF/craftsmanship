# Oil Finishes for Woodturning
A technical guide to oil-based finishes used in woodturning and small woodworking.  
Includes curing behavior, durability ranking, application method, compatibility with waxes, and best-use cases.

# 1. Overview of Oil Types

Woodturning oils fall into two categories:

## **Polymerizing (Curable) Oils**
These oils harden by oxidation. They form a durable internal matrix.

- Pure Tung Oil  
- Raw Linseed Oil  
- Walnut Oil (partially polymerizing)  
- Blended “Danish” or “Tung” Oils (vary widely)

## **Non-Polymerizing Oils**
These never harden. Useful as carriers, lubricants, or soft finishes.

- Mineral Oil  
- Food-grade butcher-block oils  
- Some nut oils (not all cure reliably)

---

# 2. Pure Tung Oil
**The gold standard for durable, natural finishes.**

### Properties:
- Fully polymerizing  
- Waterproof when cured  
- Non-yellowing  
- Hard but natural feel  
- Enhances grain  
- Slow curing (7–30 days)

### Best For:
- Utility bowls  
- Goblets (exterior)  
- Cutting boards  
- Handles  
- Anything requiring durability

### Application:
1. Apply very thin coat.  
2. Allow 10–20 min absorption.  
3. Wipe completely dry.  
4. Repeat after 24–48 hours.  
5. Full cure in 1–4 weeks.

### Notes:
- Do not build thick coats — it will stay tacky.  
- Works extremely well under wax finishes.

# 3. Raw Linseed Oil (Not “Boiled”)
### Properties:
- Polymerizing, but slow  
- Warmer, amber tone  
- Traditional finish  
- Needs long cure times (days to weeks)

### Best For:
- Traditional look on hardwoods  
- Tool handles  
- Furniture-like grain warmth

### Avoid For:
- Anything requiring quick turnaround  
- Items that contact liquids before fully cured

### Notes:
Commercial “boiled linseed oil” contains metal driers — not recommended for utility or food-adjacent pieces.

---

# 4. Walnut Oil
### Properties:
- Light, smooth  
- Partially polymerizing  
- Builds a satin, natural finish  
- Food-safe when pure  
- Cures faster than raw linseed, slower than tung oil

### Best For:
- Bowls  
- Spoons  
- Functional kitchenware  
- Pieces that benefit from hand-warming over time

### Notes:
Can go rancid if not fully polymerized; always apply thin and let cure.

---

# 5. Mineral Oil (Non-Polymerizing)
### Properties:
- Never cures  
- Stable, non-rancid  
- Food-safe  
- Best lubricant for soft paste waxes  
- No waterproofing by itself

### Best For:
- Paste wax formulations  
- Cutting boards (temporary)  
- Soft natural finishes  
- Aromatic woods (preserves scent)

### Notes:
Mineral oil alone is not a finish; use in combination with beeswax for functional results.

---

# 6. Oil-Wax Blends (Home or Commercial)
A combination of curing oil + wax gives the best of both worlds.

### Common Blend:
- Tung Oil + Beeswax  
- (Optionally thinned with citrus solvent)

### Properties:
- Harder than plain wax  
- Softer than cured oil  
- Satin feel  
- Smells natural  
- Easy to refresh

### Best For:
- Utility bowls  
- Handles  
- Everyday-use items  

### Application:
1. Apply thin.  
2. Let sit 5–10 minutes.  
3. Buff.  
4. Let cure 24–48 hours.  
5. Repeat for depth.

# 7. Danish Oil / Wiping Varnishes
These are *not* pure oils — they contain:
- oil (tung/linseed)
- varnish resin
- solvent

### Properties:
- Fast drying  
- Some durability  
- More “plastic” feel compared to pure oils  
- Can build surface sheen

### Best For:
- Furniture  
- Decorative turnings  
- Items needing quick finishing

### Avoid For:
- Food-contact items  
- Goblets or interiors  
- Aromatic woods

### Notes:
Quality varies drastically by brand.

# 8. Oil Behavior on Different Woods

| Wood Type | Recommended Oils | Avoid |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Elm (porous) | Tung oil, oil-wax blend | Thick varnishes |
| Juniper (aromatic) | Light tung oil, walnut oil | Heavy poly finishes |
| Maple | Tung, walnut, Danish | Raw linseed (slow cure) |
| Cedar | Tung or walnut | Thick film finishes |
| Ash | Tung oil, oil-wax finish | Pure wax alone (needs oil base) |

---

# 9. Combining Oils and Waxes

### Best General Combination:
**Tung Oil (cured) + Medium-Hard Wax**

### For porous, leaking vessels:
**Tung Oil base + Soft Paste Wax melted in**

### For high-durability objects:
**Tung Oil + Carnauba Wax blend**

### For pieces where scent matters:
**Very light oil + beeswax paste**

### For decorative gloss:
**Danish Oil + Carnauba Wax or Friction Polish**

---

# 10. Durability Ranking (Most → Least)

1. Pure polymerized tung oil  
2. Tung oil + wax blend  
3. Danish oil / wiping varnish  
4. Medium-hard wax (beeswax + carnauba)  
5. Soft paste wax  
6. Mineral oil alone  

---

# 11. Sheen Options

| Finish | Sheen |
|--------|--------|
| Pure tung oil | Satin |
| Tung-oil + wax | Satin / low gloss |
| Medium-hard wax | Satin–semi-gloss |
| Hard carnauba wax | Gloss |
| Friction polish | High gloss |
| Mineral oil | Matte |

---

# 12. Safety Notes

- Oil-soaked rags **can spontaneously combust** — lay flat to dry.  
- Always apply oils in thin coats.  
- Do not use “boiled linseed oil” on food-contact pieces.  
- Allow tung oil to fully cure before waxing.
