# 1. Overview of Finish Types

Different finishes serve different purposes. No single finish is ideal for every project.

| Finish Type              | Durability | Shine | Feel | Waterproofing | Best For |
|-------------------------|-----------|-------|------|---------------|-----------|
| Soft Paste Wax          | Low       | Low   | Natural | Low–Med      | Porous woods, food-safe bowls |
| Medium-Hard Wax         | Medium    | Satin | Smooth | Medium        | General-purpose finishing |
| Hard Carnauba Wax       | High      | High  | Slick  | Medium–High   | Decorative bowls, display pieces |
| Tung Oil (Cured)        | High      | Satin | Hard   | High          | Utility items, cutting boards |
| Tung Oil + Wax          | High      | Satin | Smooth | Med–High      | Everyday-use pieces |
| Microcrystalline Wax    | Very High | Low–Med| Dry    | High          | Tools, metal, handles |
| Friction Polish         | Medium    | High  | Glossy | Low           | Pens, ornaments, small turnings |

# 2. Choosing the Right Finish

## 2.1 Porous Woods (Elm, Ash, Oak)
These woods have open pores that require **penetration** rather than a surface film.

**Recommended:**
- Soft Paste Wax  
- Medium-Hard Wax  
- Tung Oil + Wax  
- Heat-assisted pore sealing  

**Avoid:**
- Pure hard wax (won’t penetrate)
- Renaissance-style microcrystalline wax (surface film only)

---

## 2.2 Functional Items (Goblets, Bowls, Cutting Boards)
These need durability, moisture resistance, and a natural feel.

**Recommended:**
- Pure tung oil (fully cured)
- Tung oil + beeswax finish
- Medium-hard wax

**Notes:**
Tung oil must be *fully polymerized* before use — often 7–30 days.

---

## 2.3 Decorative Items (Display bowls, art pieces)
Here appearance and sheen matter more than utility.

**Recommended:**
- Hard carnauba wax blend
- Friction polish (for gloss)
- Medium-hard wax for satin finish

---

## 2.4 Aromatic Woods (Juniper, Cedar)
Avoid heavy film finishes that block scent.

**Recommended:**
- Soft paste wax (beeswax + mineral oil)
- Light tung oil underneath, wax on top

---

## 2.5 Tools and Handles
Handles need toughness and resistance to hand oils.

**Recommended:**
- Tung oil base
- Microcrystalline/carnauba wax topcoat

---

# 3. Understanding Finish Behavior

## 3.1 Oils
Oils penetrate wood, harden (if polymerizing), and enhance grain.

### Pure Tung Oil
- Hard, waterproof polymerized finish  
- Slow cure  
- Excellent for items that get handled or washed  

### Raw Linseed (not boiled)
- Slow cure  
- Warm amber tone  
- Often used in traditional finishes  

---

## 3.2 Waxes
Waxes provide feel, sheen, and water resistance but **do not harden deeply**.

### Beeswax
- Soft, warm, natural  
- Ideal for soft pastes  
- Does not cure  
- Great for sealing pores when melted in

### Carnauba Wax
- Hardest natural wax  
- Adds durability and shine  
- Must be blended with softer waxes or oils  

### Microcrystalline Wax
- Extremely durable  
- Film-forming  
- Low sheen  
- Great for tools, metal, high-handling surfaces

# 4. Application Techniques

## 4.1 Wax Melting-In Method (Pore Sealing)
Best for elm, ash, and other porous woods.

1. Warm the piece (heat gun on low or hair dryer).  
2. Apply soft or medium wax.  
3. Reheat until wax liquifies and absorbs.  
4. Let cool and solidify.  
5. Buff.  
6. Repeat 2–3 times if sealing leaks.

---

## 4.2 Tung Oil Application
1. Apply very thin coat.  
2. Let penetrate 10–20 minutes.  
3. Wipe off completely.  
4. Let cure 24–48 hours between coats.  
5. Full cure takes 7–30 days.  

For added smoothness: Wax after fully cured.

---

## 4.3 Hard Wax Buffing
1. Apply a small amount with cloth.  
2. Allow to haze.  
3. Buff to shine with cotton.  
4. Mechanical buffing increases gloss.

---

## 4.4 Friction Polish (Lathe Only)
1. Apply while spinning at high speed.  
2. Use friction heat to cure shellac/wax/oil mixture.  
3. Buff to gloss.  

Not suitable for functional interiors.

# 5. Finish Selection Matrix

| Project Type | Recommended Finish | Notes |
|--------------|--------------------|-------|
| Elm goblet interior | Soft or medium wax melted in | Best leak sealing |
| Elm goblet exterior | Medium-hard wax or friction polish | Depends on sheen | 
| Decorative bowl | Hard wax or friction polish | High gloss |
| Utility bowl | Tung oil + beeswax | Durable |
| Cutting board | Pure tung oil (multiple coats) | Food-safe after cure |
| Juniper bowl | Soft wax | Preserves aroma |
| Tool handle | Tung oil + microcrystalline wax | Tough & sweat-resistant |
| Metal ferrules / hardware | Microcrystalline wax | Prevents rust & prints |

---

# 6. Solvents and Additives

## d-Limonene (Orange Oil)
- Natural solvent  
- Improves spreadability  
- Enhances penetration  
- Adds citrus scent  
- Use at 2–5%  

## Mineral Oil
- Non-curing oil that keeps wax soft  
- Perfect for paste waxes  
- Food-safe versions available  

## Mineral Spirits (Odorless)
- Strong solvent  
- Used for hard paste waxes  
- Evaporates completely  

---

# 7. Safety Notes
- Always melt wax in a **double boiler** — wax is flammable.  
- Never heat solvents directly over flame.  
- Store waxes in closed containers.  
- Let tung oil fully cure before food contact.
