# Woodturning Wax Recipes
A curated set of wax formulas for bowls, goblets, utensils, artistic turnings, tool handles, and general woodworking.  
These formulas are designed to give you a full range of finishes from soft, pore-filling waxes to hard, high-gloss protective waxes.

## 1. Soft Paste Wax (Beeswax + Mineral Oil)
**Best for:**  
- sealing porous woods (elm, ash)  
- goblets, bowls, utensils  
- food-safe work  
- matte to satin finish  
- maintaining aromatic woods (juniper)

**Formula (by weight):**
- 1 part beeswax  
- 4 parts mineral oil  
- *optional:* 2–5% d-limonene for scent & improved spread

**Instructions:**  
Melt beeswax in a double boiler → warm mineral oil → combine → add d-limonene off heat → pour into tins → cool.

---

## 2. Medium-Hard Paste Wax (Beeswax + Carnauba + Oil)
**Best for:**  
- general-purpose finishing  
- decorative bowls  
- items that need more durability  
- satin sheen

**Formula:**  
- 1 part beeswax  
- 0.25 part carnauba wax  
- 3–4 parts mineral oil  
- *optional:* 2–5% d-limonene

**Notes:**  
Carnauba dramatically increases hardness and water resistance.

## 3. Hard Finishing Wax (Carnauba + Beeswax + Solvent)
**Best for:**  
- high gloss  
- durable exterior surfaces  
- display pieces  
- furniture-like finishes

**Formula:**  
- 2 parts beeswax  
- 1 part carnauba wax  
- thin with mineral spirits **or** d-limonene until paste consistency

**Notes:**  
Behaves similarly to commercial paste waxes like Minwax.

## 4. Tung Oil + Beeswax (Oil-Wax Finish)
**Best for:**  
- durable natural finish  
- cutting boards, trays, tool handles  
- pieces that need a cure + protective topcoat

**Formula:**  
- Pure tung oil  
- Small amount of melted beeswax (5–10%)

**Instructions:**  
Mix warm tung oil with melted beeswax → apply thin → cure fully → buff.

---

## 5. Microcrystalline/Carnauba “Renaissance-Style” Wax
**Best for:**  
- metal, leather, instruments, tools  
- fingerprint-resistant finishes  
- extremely hard, durable surface films

**Formula:**  
- 1 part microcrystalline wax  
- 1 part carnauba  
- small amount of solvent (mineral spirits or d-limonene)

**Notes:**  
Creates a dry, hard, museum-style finish. Not ideal for sealing porous wood.

---

## 6. Friction Polish (Shellac + Oil + Wax)
**Best for:**  
- small turned items  
- pens  
- goblet exteriors  
- high-gloss lathe finishes

**Formula:**  
- 1 part shellac  
- 1 part alcohol  
- 1 part oil (walnut or mineral)  
- small amount of melted beeswax

**Instructions:**  
Apply on the lathe at high speed → friction-cure → buff.

# Choosing the Right Wax

| Finish Type              | Durability | Shine | Penetration | Best Uses |
|-------------------------|-----------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Soft Paste Wax          | Low       | Low   | High        | Elm sealing, food-safe bowls |

| Tung Oil + Beeswax      | High      | Satin | Medium      | Utility items, boards |
| Renaissance-Style Wax   | Very High | Low–Med| Very Low   | Metal, tools, nonporous items |
| Friction Polish         | Medium    | Very High | Low     | Lathe-turned art, pens |

# Application Tips

### For porous woods (elm, ash):
Use **soft or medium** wax and melt it in with a heat gun to fill pores.

### For high-gloss finishes:
Use **hard carnauba blends** or friction polish.

### For functional, handled objects:
Use a **tung oil + beeswax** blend.

### For metal or tool protection:
Use **microcrystalline/carnauba** wax.

# Notes on Additives

### d-Limonene (orange oil)
- improves spreadability  
- helps wax penetrate  
- smells amazing  
- softens paste slightly  
Use 2–5% by weight.

### Mineral Oil
- keeps wax soft  
- does not cure  
- never turns rancid  
- ideal for soft pastes  

### Carnauba Wax
- hardest natural wax  
- increases water resistance  
- improves scratch resistance

# Safety
Always melt waxes using a double boiler.  
Never heat solvents over an open flame.  
Store waxes in sealed tins away from heat sources.
