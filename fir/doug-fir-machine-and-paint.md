# Doug Fir Salvage & Painting Strategy

## Why Doug Fir

* **Free or nearly free** from construction site salvage.
* **Strong, easy to joint/plane**, but soft and blotchy — poor staining behavior.
* **Paint hides species and defects**, elevating perceived value dramatically.

## Prep Workflow

1. **Joint & Plane Boards**

   * Surface all faces cleanly.
   * Eliminate cupping/twisting.

2. **Edge Treatment (Optional)**

   * Slight bevel or chamfer reduces drip accumulation and increases visual sharpness.

3. **Primer Stage**

   * Apply two coats of high-quality primer (Zinsser BIN or Kilz 2).
   * Sand between coats:

     * First pass: 180 grit (raise grain removal).
     * Second pass: 220 grit for smoothness.
   * Tack cloth after every sanding.
   * Let primer dry fully before sanding — rushing this can tear or clog paper.

4. **Paint Stage**

   * Use interior/exterior-grade latex for durability.
   * Thin slightly (1–5%) with water for better leveling if needed.
   * Apply two light coats, sanding lightly with 320 grit between if ultra-smooth finish desired.
   * Paint **edges last** with separate foam brush to prevent runs.

## Painting Tips & Drip Prevention

* **Use raking light**: Position a low-angle light source to instantly expose drips and brush marks.
* **Work top to bottom**: Let gravity be your ally — it’s easier to fix sags when you end at the bottom.
* **Feather your strokes**: Always lift off gently at the end of a stroke to avoid heavy buildup.
* **Dedicated edge pass**:

  * Use a second brush or foam applicator with **barely any paint**.
  * Hit edges last and very lightly.
* **Drip patrol loop**:

  * After finishing one coat, circle the piece again after 2–3 minutes.
  * Catch fresh drips with a clean brush edge or cloth.
* **Avoid overloading**: Dip lightly, offload onto cardboard, and apply in thin coats.
* **Vertical surfaces**: Use thinner coats or lay the piece flat if possible.

## Finish Coat

* Use wipe-on polyurethane (satin or gloss depending on style).
* Apply in thin, even coats with lint-free cloth.
* At least 2 coats recommended. Sand lightly between with gray Scotch-Brite.

## Repair Strategy (Later Damage)

* Clean area → sand lightly → touch up paint → re-apply wipe-on poly.
* Use toothpick or tiny brush for precision touch-up.

## Summary Philosophy

> Doug Fir doesn’t stain well, but under good paint, it becomes elite. You’re turning scrap into custom-grade work. With sharp lines, clean finishes, and a bit of discipline, painted fir becomes a design statement — not a compromise.

Salvage smart. Build clean. Paint like a professional. The results speak louder than the materials.
