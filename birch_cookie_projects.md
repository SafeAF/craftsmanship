## 🧊 Drying Instructions

* **Seal both flat faces and the edge (bark)** with Anchorseal.
* **Stack between cardboard or kraft paper** to slow drying.
* **Weight the top** of the stack to prevent cupping.
* **Dry indoors**, away from sunlight and wind.

### Bark Considerations

* Leave bark on **only if tightly attached**.
* Apply **thin CA glue** or **shellac** along the cambium line to keep bark in place during drying.
* If bark detaches, **chamfer the edge** and sand clean for a polished look.

For best results, track drying progress monthly and reapply Anchorseal if faces appear dry or checked.

Use a moisture meter to monitor internal content before final sanding or finishing.
