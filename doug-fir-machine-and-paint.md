# Doug Fir Salvage & Painting Strategy

## Why Doug Fir

* **Free or nearly free** from construction site salvage.
* **Strong, easy to joint/plane**, but soft and blotchy — poor staining behavior.
* **Paint hides species and defects**, elevating perceived value dramatically.

## Prep Workflow

1. **Joint & Plane Boards**

   * Surface all faces cleanly.
   * Eliminate cupping/twisting.

2. **Edge Treatment (Optional)**

   * Slight bevel or chamfer reduces drip accumulation and increases visual sharpness.

3. **Primer Stage**

   * Apply two coats of high-quality primer (Zinsser BIN or Kilz 2).
   * Sand between coats:

     * First pass: 180 grit (raise grain removal).
     * Second pass: 220 grit for smoothness.
   * Tack cloth after every sanding.

4. **Paint Stage**

   * Use interior/exterior-grade latex for durability.
   * Thin slightly (1–5%) with water for better leveling if needed.
   * Apply two light coats, sanding lightly with 320 grit between if ultra-smooth finish desired.
   * Paint **edges last** with separate foam brush to prevent runs.

## Drip & Defect Mitigation

* **Raking light** exposes wet drips before they cure.
* **Dedicated edge brush**, nearly dry, lets you control corners.
* **Walk the piece** 1–2 minutes after coating to catch flaws.

## Finish Coat

* Use wipe-on polyurethane (satin or gloss depending on style).
* Apply in thin, even coats with lint-free cloth.
* At least 2 coats recommended. Sand lightly between with gray Scotch-Brite.

## Repair Strategy (Later Damage)

* Clean area → sand lightly → touch up paint → re-apply wipe-on poly.
* Use toothpick or tiny brush for precision touch-up.

## Summary Philosophy

> Doug Fir doesn’t stain well, but under good paint, it becomes elite. You’re turning scrap into custom-grade work. With sharp lines, clean finishes, and a bit of discipline, painted fir becomes a design statement — not a compromise.

Salvage smart. Build clean. Paint like a professional. The results speak louder than the materials.
