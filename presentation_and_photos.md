🧭 Chooch’s Field Guide: Photographing Work That Feels Alive
🎨 1. Mood & Story

Show contrast: refined object vs. rough background.
Example: polished birch bowl on rusted steel or a forge table.

Include evidence of work — a chisel, shaving curl, hammer, dust, or glove nearby.

Avoid sterile white backgrounds unless documenting dimensions.

☀️ 2. Light

Golden hours: early morning or late afternoon.

Indoors: use window light from the side; never overhead or flash.

Angle light to rake across grain or tool marks.

Optional: reflect light with white paper opposite the source.

Lower exposure slightly (–0.3 EV) to keep detail in highlights.

📷 3. Camera Setup (Phone or DSLR)

Focus on the nearest highlight (rim, bevel, or knot).

Use f/2.8–f/4 or portrait mode for shallow depth; background should fall soft.

Turn off flash.

Shoot slightly wider, crop later.

Clean lens with cloth every session.

🪵 4. Composition
Technique	Description
Rule of Thirds	Place subject off-center for natural balance.
Leading Lines	Use tools, planks, or light streaks to direct the eye.
Negative Space	Leave some quiet background; lets the object “breathe.”
Texture Contrast	Pair smooth with rough, warm with cool.
