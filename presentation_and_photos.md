# 🧭 Field Guide: Photographing Work That Feels Alive

## 🎨 1. Mood & Story
- Show **contrast** — a refined object against a rough background.  
  *Example:* polished birch bowl on rusted steel or an anvil.  
- Include **evidence of work**: a chisel, shaving curl, hammer, or glove nearby.  
- Avoid sterile white backgrounds unless documenting dimensions or finish details.

---

## ☀️ 2. Light
- **Golden hours:** early morning or late afternoon.  
- **Indoors:** use window light from the side; never overhead or flash.  
- Angle the light to rake across grain, bevels, or tool marks.  
- Reflect light with white paper or cloth opposite the source for balance.  
- Lower exposure slightly (`–0.3 EV`) to protect highlights and keep texture.

---

## 📷 3. Camera Setup
- Focus on the **nearest highlight** (rim, bevel, or knot).  
- Use **f/2.8–f/4** or portrait mode for shallow depth; let the background fall soft.  
- Turn off flash.  
- Shoot slightly wider and crop later for composition control.  
- Clean lens before each session.

## 🪵 4. Composition

| Technique | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Rule of Thirds** | Place subject off-center for natural balance. |
| **Leading Lines** | Use tools, planks, or shadows to direct the eye toward the piece. |
| **Negative Space** | Leave quiet background area so the object “breathes.” |
| **Texture Contrast** | Pair smooth with rough, warm with cool surfaces. |

## ⚙️ 5. Background Pairings

| Material | Works Best On | Avoid |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Birch / Maple / Ash** | Steel, slate, concrete | Warm-tone wood backgrounds |
| **Walnut / Cherry** | Brick, rust, copper | Blue-gray metals |
| **Forged Iron / Steel** | Pale wood or linen | Dark metal benches |

---

## 🔥 6. Process & Emotion
- Show **half-finished states**: freshly oiled wood, glowing forge steel, curls of shavings.  
- These outperform polished product shots because they *show transformation*.  
- Hands in frame (even blurred) increase engagement — proof of craftsmanship.

---

## 🧰 7. Color & Tone
- Cool backgrounds amplify warm materials, and vice versa.  
- Desaturate slightly in post for a timeless, cinematic tone.  
- Keep natural color fidelity — don’t oversaturate or over-sharpen.

---

## 🕯️ 8. Finishing Touch
- Wipe pieces clean but **don’t erase all patina**. Minor tool marks add honesty.  
- Label recurring aesthetics for brand cohesion:  
  - *Workbench Light* — natural light on metal table.  
  - *After the Turn* — fresh lathe pieces before finishing.  
  - *Farm Foundry* — forged or turned items shot near tools.
