# Wipe-On Poly Application & Recovery Tips

## Surface Prep Best Practices

* **Primer Sanding**: Always sand between primer coats.

  * First coat: 180 grit to knock down raised grain.
  * Second coat: 220 grit (palm sander recommended) to get glass-flat surface.
  * Tack cloth after every sanding pass.

* **Paint Touch-Up**: Any missed primer/paint spots can be fixed later:

  1. Let poly cure 24–48h.
  2. Lightly scuff exposed spot with 400–600 grit.
  3. Repaint missed spot using fine brush or toothpick.
  4. Let dry, then reapply wipe-on poly.

## Poly Application

* **Cloth should be damp, not dripping.**
* **Apply in long, even strokes.**
* Do NOT go back over tacky areas.
* **Watch corners and verticals** — drips start here.

## Edge Trick: The Chad Edge Pass

* **Paint edges LAST** using a nearly dry foam brush.
* Control application, minimize buildup.
* Revisit edges 1–2 min after full coat to catch drips.

## Outdoor Considerations

* **Avoid direct sun** if possible. Morning or evening ideal.
* Use a tent/box to protect from bugs, dust.
* Don't apply on a hot surface; cool first.

## Drip Recovery & Spot Fix

* Let drip cure.
* Sand with 400 grit until smooth.
* Spot-repaint or blend with tinted poly if needed.
* Re-poly the area lightly.

## Tools That Help

* Raking light at low angle to surface.
* Cardboard drip shield while drying.
* Dedicated foam brush for edges.
* Gray Scotch-Brite for gentle between-coat abrasion.

## Philosophy

> Painting is less forgiving than stain, but more transformative. Especially when working with cheap or rough materials like Doug Fir — paint elevates it, hides its origin, and lets your craftsmanship shine.
